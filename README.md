# Care Bears NES Homebrew
This is source code for Care Bears NES Homebrew I made because my friend had an idea for care bears NES platformer. I made this just to showoff, but I didn't plan to make this into a full game.

This is nothing more than an interactive file selection menu. You can select a file and which bear to play as (which does nothing), copy files, erase them and use TEST function to fill the first file with some progress (though copying that file to other files can cause glitches).

The "Leftovers" folder contains earlier builds showing the development progress.

This "game" can be compiled with ASM6 assembler.

(also yes, I sometimes misspelled bears as "bares")
